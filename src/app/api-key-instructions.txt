Steps to test your private API key for functionality

1. Inside the app folder, create a file named 'tempVars.ts' <- MUST MATCH EXACTLY FOR SECURITY

2. Open .gitignore inside the src folder and make sure 'tempVars.ts' is listed at the bottom

3. Inside your 'tempVars.ts' file paste the URL object below replace <YOUR_API_KEY> 
    with your api key from airtable.

export const URL: {BASE: string, API_KEY: string, TABLE_REF: {MASTER: string, PROJECTS: string, FEEDBACK: string}} = {
    BASE: 'https://api.airtable.com/v0/app7144W3ptq642q7/',
    API_KEY: '<YOUR_API_KEY>',
    TABLE_REF: {
        MASTER: 'Master%20List',
        PROJECTS: 'Projects',
        FEEDBACK: 'Feedback'
    }
}

4. Save everything, do not use any git commands unless you're certain
    you're not going to push your private api key to the repo.

5. Run ng serve, go to localhost:4200 in your browser and you should see an unformatted list of
    startups with 'Company Name', 'Summary', 'Location', and 'Theme(s)'.

6. If you do NOT see the list of names, check the console to see what error you're getting.
